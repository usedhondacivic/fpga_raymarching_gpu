# FPGA Fractal GPU

A FPGA GPU designed to render self similar 3D fractals.

First designed using GLSL, then written in Verilog and simulated using Verilator with VGA simulation using SDL2, then ported to eh DE1SoC single board computer.

Final project for Cornell University's ECE 5760: Advanced Microcontrollers.
